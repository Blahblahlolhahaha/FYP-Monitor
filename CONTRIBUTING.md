# Just standardised stuff

## Branching

### Things to note

- Don't touch `master` until FYP is over 
- Branch from `dev`
- There's 3 branch types
- *Do not* touch `master` until FYP is over.

### Branch types

1. Feature 
    - This should be the default.
    - As the name implies, for features and tasks
2. Fix
    - Small bug patches that got caught later
3. Docs
    -  Documentation changes

### Branch naming

```
Format:
<type>[-<optional type>]/<name-of-what-you-are-doing>

Example:
feature/packet-logging-to-disk
docs/added-branch-conventions
```
